# Chatbot-GUI-in-C
Project Description :
This project is a "Graphical User Interface (GUI) based Chatbot" application built entirely in the "C programming language" using the "Windows API (Win32)". It simulates a basic conversational bot that can respond to user inputs with predefined, context-aware answers.
The chatbot is designed to demonstrate "event-driven programming", "string handling", and "GUI component integration" using pure C—without any external libraries or frameworks.
It serves as an excellent academic mini-project for understanding how to combine logic, user interaction, and graphical interface design in C, which is traditionally considered a systems-level language.
The chatbot offers various built-in capabilities such as:
⦁	Displaying current "date" and "time"
⦁	Answering basic "programming and technical questions"
⦁	Providing "fun facts", "jokes", and "developer tips"
⦁	Handling "user queries" via keyword matching
This project is modular, lightweight, and runs efficiently on any Windows system, making it ideal for learning "Win32 API programming" and building foundational knowledge in "software UI/UX development in C".
